 The Automated Resume Relevance Check System automates resume evaluation, solving the manual, inconsistent process at Innomatics Research Labs. The system generates a relevance score (0-100), highlights skill gaps, provides a fit verdict, and offers personalized feedback using a hybrid of keyword matching and LLM-based semantic understanding.
